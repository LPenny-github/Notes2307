# pwd (print working directory)

## what

```
return working directory name
```

## options

```
The options are as follows:

     -L      Display the logical current working directory.

     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
             links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.
```

## why isn't the Terminal designed to display the absolute path by default?

for better readability (by limiting the information in the pane)
